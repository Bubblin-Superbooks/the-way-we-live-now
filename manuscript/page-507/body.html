<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"Oh, Felix! how brutal it is to speak to me in that way."</p><p>"It may be brutal; but you know, mother, business is business. You want me to marry this girl because of her money."</p><p>"You want to marry her yourself."</p><p>"I'm quite a philosopher about it. I want her money; and when one wants money, one should make up one's mind how much or how little one means to take,â€”and whether one is sure to get it."</p><p>"I don't think there can be any doubt."</p><p>"If I were to marry her, and if the money wasn't there, it would be very like cutting my throat then, mother. If a man plays and loses, he can play again and perhaps win; but when a fellow goes in for an heiress, and gets the wife without the money, he feels a little hampered you know."</p><p>"Of course he'd pay the money first."</p></div> </div>
