Do as your papa bids you," said Madame Melmotte.</p><p>"No!" said Melmotte. "She does not care who is ruined, because we saved her from that reprobate."</p><p>"She will sign them now," said Madame Melmotte.</p><p>"No;â€”I will not sign them," said Marie. "If I am to be married to Lord Nidderdale as you all say, I am sure I ought to sign nothing without telling him. And if the property was once made to be mine, I don't think I ought to give it up again because papa says that he is going to be ruined. I think that's a reason for not giving it up again."</p><p>"It isn't yours to give. It's mine," said Melmotte gnashing his teeth.</p><p>"Then you can do what you like with it without my signing," said Marie.</p></div> </div>
