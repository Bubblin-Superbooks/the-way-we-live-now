Mrs. Hurtle had at once declared the fact to Mrs. Pipkin, and Mrs. Pipkin had been proud of the position of her lodger. Ruby had herself seen Paul Montague at the house, and had known that he had taken Mrs. Hurtle to Lowestoft. And it had also become known to the two women, the aunt and her niece, that Mrs. Hurtle had seen Roger Carbury on the sands at Lowestoft. Thus the whole story with most of its details,—not quite with all,—had come round to Lady Carbury's ears. "What he has told you, my dear, is true. Much as I disapprove of Mr. Montague, you do not suppose that I would deceive you."</p><p>"How can he know, mamma?"</p><p>"He does know. I cannot explain to you how. He has been at the same house."</p><p>"Has he seen her?"</p><p>"I do not know that he has, but Roger Carbury has seen her. If I write to him you will believe what he says?"</p></div> </div>
