Don't you remember the blowsy fat woman at the top of the stairs;—a regular horror?"</p><p>"Didn't look at her. I was only thinking what a lot of money it all cost."</p><p>"I remember her, and if Georgiana Longestaffe thinks I'm going there to make an acquaintance with Madame Melmotte she is very much mistaken. And if she thinks that that is the way to get married, I think she is mistaken again." Nothing perhaps is so efficacious in preventing men from marrying as the tone in which married women speak of the struggles made in that direction by their unmarried friends.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
