Then the elder spoke of the trouble that was nearest to her heart at the moment. "Do you think he gambles?"</p><p>"He has got no money, mamma."</p><p>"I fear that might not hinder him. And he has money with him, though, for him and such friends as he has, it is not much. If he gambles everything is lost."</p><p>"I suppose they all do play,â€”more or less."</p><p>"I have not known that he played. I am wearied too, out of all heart, by his want of consideration to me. It is not that he will not obey me. A mother perhaps should not expect obedience from a grown-up son. But my word is nothing to him. He has no respect for me. He would as soon do what is wrong before me as before the merest stranger."</p><p>"He has been so long his own master, mamma."</p></div> </div>
