<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">without you, now that you have once owned that you have loved me. I cannot think it possible that love, such as I suppose yours must have been, could be made to cease all at a moment. Mine can't. I don't think it is natural that we should be parted.
If you want corroboration of my story go yourself to Mrs. Hurtle. Anything is better than that we both should be broken-hearted.
Yours most affectionately,
Paul Montague.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
