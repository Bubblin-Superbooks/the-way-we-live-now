You're breaking your heart about going there;â€”are you not?"</p><p>"I don't like it, Mrs. Hurtle."</p><p>"And this man will make you mistress of his house. You say he isn't good at speaking; but I tell you I never came across an honester man in the whole course of my life, or one who I think would treat a woman better. What's the use of a glib tongue if there isn't a heart with it? What's the use of a lot of tinsel and lacker, if the real metal isn't there? Sir Felix Carbury could talk, I dare say, but you don't think now he was a very fine fellow."</p><p>"He was so beautiful, Mrs. Hurtle!"</p><p>"But he hadn't the spirit of a mouse in his bosom. Well, Ruby, you have one more choice left you. Shall it be John Crumb or Mrs. Buggins?"</p><p>"He wouldn't come, Mrs. Hurtle."</p></div> </div>
