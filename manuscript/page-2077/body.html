Paul pleaded his own case with indignant heat, not understanding at first that Roger had come to him on a friendly mission.</p><p>"She did answer your letter."</p><p>"I have not had a line from her;—not a word!"</p><p>"She did answer your letter."</p><p>"What did she say to me?"</p><p>"Nay,—you must ask her that."</p><p>"But if she will not see me?"</p><p>"She will see you. I can tell you that. And I will tell you this also;—that she wrote to you as a girl writes to the lover whom she does wish to see."</p><p>"Is that true?" exclaimed Paul, jumping up.</p><p>"I am here especially to tell you that it is true. I should hardly come on such a mission if there were a doubt. You may go to her, and need have nothing to fear,—unless, indeed, it be the opposition of her mother."</p></div> </div>
