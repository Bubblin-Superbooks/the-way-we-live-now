He says he comes in and wakes me, but I never remember it."</p><p>"How many horses have you got at Leighton, Dolly?"</p><p>"How many? There were five, but I think that fellow down there sold one; but then I think he bought another. I know he did something."</p><p>"Who rides them?"</p><p>"He does, I suppose. That is, of course, I ride them myself, only I so seldom get down. Somebody told me that Grasslough was riding two of them last week. I don't think I ever told him he might. I think he tipped that fellow of mine; and I call that a low kind of thing to do. I'd ask him, only I know he'd say that I had lent them. Perhaps I did when I was tight, you know."</p><p>"You and Grasslough were never pals."</p></div> </div>
