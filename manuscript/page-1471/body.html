<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>My dear Roger,â€”
I think it right to tell you at once what has occurred to-day. I have proposed to Miss Carbury and she has accepted me. You have long known what my feelings were, and I have also known yours. I have known, too, that Miss Carbury has more than once declined to take your offer. Under these circumstances I cannot think that I have been untrue to friendship in what I have done, or that I have proved myself ungrateful for the affectionate kindness which you have always shown me. I am authorised by Hetta to say that, had I never spoken to her, it must have been the same to you.</p></blockquote><p>This was hardly a fair representation of what had been said, but the writer, looking back upon his interview with the lady, thought that it had been implied.</p></div> </div>
