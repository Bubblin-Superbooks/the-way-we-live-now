"Going to dine here, Dolly?" said Sir Felix.</p><p>"I suppose I shall, because it's such a lot of trouble to go anywhere else. I'm engaged somewhere, I know; but I'm not up to getting home and dressing. By George! I don't know how fellows do that kind of thing.

Why shouldn't fellows begin to hunt at two or three, so that a fellow needn't get up in the middle of the night?"</p><p>"Because one can't ride by moonlight, Dolly."</p></div> </div>
