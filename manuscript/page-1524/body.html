I suppose it isn't always easy even for a man like that to get a couple of hundred thousand together. I know I've never found it easy to get a thousand. If he has borrowed a trifle from Longestaffe to make up the girl's money, I shan't complain. You stand to your guns. There's no harm done till the parson has said the word."</p><p>"You couldn't let me have a couple of hundred;â€”could you, sir?" suggested the son.</p><p>"No, I couldn't," replied the father with a very determined aspect.</p><p>"I'm awfully hard up."</p><p>"So am I." Then the old man toddled into his own chamber, and after sitting there ten minutes went away home.</p></div> </div>
