Ah, Paul; you can hardly know what my life has been."</p><p>"They told me that—you fought him."</p><p>"Psha;—fought him! Yes;—I was always fighting him. What are you to do but to fight cruelty, and fight falsehood, and fight fraud and treachery,—when they come upon you and would overwhelm you but for fighting? You have not been fool enough to believe that fable about a duel? I did stand once, armed, and guarded my bedroom door from him, and told him that he should only enter it over my body. He went away to the tavern and I did not see him for a week afterwards. That was the duel. And they have told you that he is not dead."</p><p>"Yes;—they have told me that."</p><p>"Who has seen him alive? I never said to you that I had seen him dead. How should I?"</p><p>"There would be a certificate."</p></div> </div>
