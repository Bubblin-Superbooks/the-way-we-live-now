I don't understand how it is that at these parties people do know each other, or whether they all go dancing about without knowing."</p><p>"Just that; I suppose when they are used to it they get introduced backwards and forwards, and then they can know each other as fast as they like. If you would wish to dance why won't you dance with me?"</p><p>"I have danced with you,â€”twice already."</p><p>"Is there any law against dancing three times?"</p><p>"But I don't especially want to dance," said Henrietta. "I think I'll go and console poor mamma, who has got nobody to speak to her." Just at this moment, however, Lady Carbury was not in that wretched condition, as an unexpected friend had come to her relief.</p></div> </div>
