I meant that he came of his own accord."</p><p>"How long was he here?"</p><p>"Two minutes before you came in. Why do you cross-question me like this? I could not help his coming. I did not desire that he might be shown up."</p><p>"You did not know that he was to come?"</p><p>"Mamma, if I am to be suspected, all is over between us."</p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"If you can think that I would deceive you, you will think so always. If you will not trust me, how am I to live with you as though you did? I knew nothing of his coming."</p><p>"Tell me this, Hetta; are you engaged to marry him?"</p><p>"No;â€”I am not."</p></div> </div>
