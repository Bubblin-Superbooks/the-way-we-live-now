Of course she looks to be married, and why should she not have Felix if she likes him best?

I look upon him as dirt in the gutter. To me, in my old-fashioned way, all his money, if he has it, can make no difference. When there is a question of marriage people at any rate should know something of each other. Who knows anything of this man? Who can be sure that she is his daughter?"</p><p>"He would give her her fortune when she married."</p></div> </div>
