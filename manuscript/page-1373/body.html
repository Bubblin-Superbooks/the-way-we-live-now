Hetta could not but sympathize with the affection manifested for her own brother, though she could hardly understand the want of reticence displayed by Marie in thus speaking of her love to one who was almost a stranger. "Felix hardly ever talks about himself to me," she said.</p><p>"If he doesn't care for me, there shall be an end of it," Marie said very gravely. "If I only knew!

That's what I think."</p><p>"It is bad," said Hetta, thinking of Roger Carbury.</p></div> </div>
