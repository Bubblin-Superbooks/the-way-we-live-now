I go pretty well everywhere, as you are aware; and I shouldn't know Mr. Brehgert if I were to see him."</p><p>"You'll meet him at the Melmottes', and, in spite of all you said once, you're glad enough to go there."</p><p>"Quite true, my dear. I don't think that you are just the person to throw that in my teeth; but never mind that. There's the butcher round the corner in Bond Street, or the man who comes to do my hair. I don't at all think of asking them to my house. But if they were suddenly to turn out wonderful men, and go everywhere, no doubt I should be glad to have them here. That's the way we live, and you are as well used to it as I am. Mr. Brehgert at present to me is like the butcher round the corner." Lady Monogram had the tickets safe under lock and key, or I think she would hardly have said this.</p><p>"He is not a bit like a butcher," said Miss Longestaffe, blazing up in real wrath.</p></div> </div>
